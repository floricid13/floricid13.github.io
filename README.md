# THE GUY SHE WAS INTERESTED IN WASN'T A GUY AT ALL
> **The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn't A Guy At All** *(気になってる人が男じゃなかった)* is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Sumiko Arai. Originally, the series began from Sumiko's Twitter account in April 2022, before being serialized on Pixiv Comic in April 2023.
>
> The series has been a critical and commercial success, with critics praising the story, artwork, and characters. It won the 2023 *Next Manga Award* in the web manga category.
## PRODUCTION 
- Since Twitter only allows four images per Tweet, chapters of the series were limited to four pages. As a result, the interactions of Aya and Mitsuki had to be depicted concisely.
- The series' editor commented that the character's faces are illustrated to be detailed enough to understand the story without the dialog, which made the series more accessible to Twitter users not from Japan.
